## Project Overview
Classic WoW holds a special place for many players, bringing back a sense of nostalgia for the early days of the game. This project aims to explore how that nostalgia shapes player satisfaction and engagement within the Classic WoW community. By diving into the thoughts, experiences, and conversations of players, we hope to gain insights that can help sustain the unique appeal of Classic WoW and keep the community thriving.

## Related Project
Azeroth Talks is closely related to another project I’m working on called Epic-Parse. While Azeroth Talks focuses specifically on player satisfaction in Classic WoW, Epic-Parse examines player satisfaction in the current version of World of Warcraft, where class balancing is one of the main drivers of player sentiment. I'm looking to expand Epic-Parse to cover a broader scope of overall player satisfaction while still recognizing that class balance plays a significant role.
