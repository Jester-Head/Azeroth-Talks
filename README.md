### Help with Data Annotation
I am currently preparing to annotate a large dataset, and your assistance would be extremely valuable. At this stage, here's how you can start getting involved:

1. **Access the Dataset**: The dataset is hosted on Kaggle. You can view and download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jesterhead/wow-classic-gamer-jargon-and-terms-dataset).

2. **Upcoming Annotation Process**: The official guidelines for annotating this dataset are being developed. I will be using Doccano. More details on this will be provided soon.

3. **Express Your Interest**: If you're interested in contributing to the annotation process, please contact me directly. We will discuss the details of the setup and how you can be involved.

4. **Stay Updated**: As the annotation guidelines and setup are finalized, I will update contributors directly. Your patience and interest are greatly appreciated during this setup phase.

5. **Questions and Collaboration**: If you have any questions or wish to discuss potential collaboration, please don't hesitate to contact me.
