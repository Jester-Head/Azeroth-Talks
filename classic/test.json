It offers something new and yet still somewhat familiar. Everyone in our raid group enjoys it, however…It is WAY too easy. Please blizzard, scale the difficulty up for the next raid. Gnomer has such great potential to be a memorable raid…but if it’s easy to steamroll within one week it won’t feel good no matter how the rest of the raid functions. You could even do a “heroic” mode…or “hardmode”. Our guild prefers to struggle a bit more to get our kills(within reason…not looking for a pre nerf cthun or anything)…BFD was great as an opening raid but for the love of god don’t make all the raids such a walk in the park.", "likes": "13 Likes", "date": "2023-12-13T05:12:49Z"}},

{"topic": "BFD is WAY too easy", "forum": "Season of Discovery", "comment": {"text": "Totally disagree. I think the difficulty is excellent where it is right now. A handful of easy bosses for weaker guilds / pugs to gear up on, and then 2 pretty hard last bosses that are still puggable. Especially now that Kelris resists were nerfed so you dont need to be as picky with the comp. These are fun, low level cap raids to provide little steps along the way to 60 (where I expect there will be harder ones), they really dont need to be designed for AOTC players to grind their teeth on for weeks at a time. Keep it chill, let people reclear on alts if they have time before p2. I might even argue Kelris in particular is still tuned a little high since if you arent in a one-shot group you will spend an absurd amount on consumables to clear it. I think BFD overall has been in a really good place esp post Kelris nerfs. Aside from maybe a slight nerf on Kelris i think this is an excellent level of difficulty. Requires some pregearing, it makes a difference what classes you bring but doesnt demand specific comps, there are mechs to pay attention to but its not a ton of multitasking… You can prog on the loot pinatas to better meet the DPS & mana checks on the last 2 bosses. But ultimately its still a pretty chill experience, which I feel like is a good thing. My 0.02", "likes": "13 Likes", "date": "2023-12-13T05:12:49Z"}},

Some people want to be on empty layers while on high pop servers and others don’t. Let them choose. Layering has honestly been great. People want megaservers or that’s the default… We could limit each server and have many smaller servers with no layers, but with character transfers available and just by sheer chance, a server can die.

{"topic": "Hunters, Season of Disappointment", "forum": "Season of Discovery", "comment": {"text": "Imagine playing a hunter right now. Listen I know hunters ‘feel’ strong now, but it’s because the people here have absolutely  no idea why that is. Hunters were always the best 19 twinks because the ranged hit table is much more generous than the melee / spell ones. No partial hits (glancing blows), lower miss rates, no parries. This means without gear a hunter performs better than other classes. As of right now hunters are at their peak of power, and they’re not even the best. Warriors still have the best parses, beating even the pre-nerf hunter rune and pet damage as they get more gear from BFD and start to come online. Casters, although they were suffering from resists in BFD, also gain a ton of new skills and scale well into the future. Right now, hunters have auto shot, pet auto attack, and pet auto skill. Once we hit 60 with these pet nerfs, we’ll just be back to auto attack and not even use the pet as it will be dead every fight. I started this seasonal journey excited, and now I’m genuinely so disappointed I don’t know why I had any hope at all to begin with.

The core issue is that Paladins are providing 2 forms for mana regeneration to their raid teams whereas horde have none currently.  Normally at max level, alliance would, and horde would each have 1 buff respectively, Blessing of Wisdom vs Mana Spring Totem.  However, with the addition of runes and current level cap of 25, there is a major imbalance.  Listed below are comparisons between the spells and runes for mana for both classes. Blessing of Wisdom vs Mana Spring Totem Blessing of Wisdom Rank 2 - 15 MP5   Level 24 Raid Buff \nMana Spring Totem Rank 1 - 10 MP5   Level 26 Party Buff Not only is Blessing of Wisdom Stronger than Mana Spring, but it’s also a raid wide buff vs a party wide buff, and shamans can’t get mana spring in the current phase due to the level 25 cap. Seal of Martyrdom vs Shamanistic Rage \nSeal of Martyrdom - 10% of damage to self from seal refunds as mana – Raid \nBuff/Constant Duration \nShamanistic Rage – 15% Atk Pwr /10% Spl Pwr / 6% Healing Pwr refunds as mana to self, 10% of that to Raid \nRaid Buff/15 second duration every 1 minute This time we are looking at a rune that restores mana to the raid constantly vs a rune that does it for 15 seconds every 1 minute. All in all, lowering Mana Spring Totem level’s requirement down to level 24 would help the situation, but more needs to be done to rectify the situation.  A big issue is totems need to be raid wide instead of party wide to make up for the imbalance of blessings.", "likes": "18 Likes", "date": "2023-12-09T22:22:58Z"}},

In light of OP,   Not particularly, because I would lose critical skills such as WotF during Gelihast and extra Shadow Resist against Kelris. For PvE, what the bottom line becomes is whether or not I’m capable of hitting the benchmarks. In PvP, I would lose Touch of Weakness against Horde Rogues and they would likely have WotF against my Fear (something a trinket doesn’t solve). But if we narrow our scope so thinly as to flatten all flavors and optimize the game out,   At that point, I no longer care because the question is structured to ignore dialogue and only win an argument. Also, let’s look at the biggest issue facing future phases – Gold gain at level cap. Markets and player exchanges will not be fun to participate in when players are farming too much gold right now. When the next wave of “Flavor of the Month” rolls through, cartels will monopolize with AH bots, demanding 30g level 12 BoEs and critical leveling quest components, pushing new players out. This will be interesting to unfold, but not engage.", "likes": "18 Likes", "date": "2023-12-09T22:22:58Z"}},

The whole thing was that a tank could sit there and take damage all day and needed a few heals to top them off, but the real challenge was losing aggro. If DPS pulled aggro, most bosses would 1 or 2 shot them. Regular dungeon mobs would 3-4 shot you and if the healer tried to compensate for your inability to manage threat, THEY would pull aggro and then it got bad.  Which is why you used CC.

{"topic": "Hunter future", "forum": "Season of Discovery", "comment": {"text": "All the changes lately make me think the folks working on SoD didn’t play back in vanilla - which is fine, it was made over 20 years ago. Or even classic era for that matter. Sub 30 was always the Hunter’s time to shine dps wise, then it falls off and you are a utility class in end game for a few odd jobs, but you can do cool stuff like solo kite hard quests, farm dungeons in a unique way and have a whole epic quest around solo Kiting skill. It was fine and fun. Hunter had its place and it felt unique. SoD seems to be about providing a new way to play classes and find new ways to be unique but the latest nerfs make it feel like 1. We should feel bad for capitalizing on our 20 year reign as sub lvl 30 S tier and 2. We need to just play the Era meta while everyone else gets a new take on things. Everyone mad at hunter now won’t feel bad for us when they can top charts by clicking one button later on. So, since we know hunter falls off at end game, and everyone seems uncomfortable with the pure dps class being at the top because it uses a pet (pocket npc), I’d just suggest some more effort go into non dps uniqueness for hunters. More tameable pets, more pet interactions that reward pet management and timing in boss fights, low level epic quests like Rok to do, things to discover that only hunters can do, companion pets only hunters can get. I donno - something. If the community doesn’t want to see the pet class at the top, give us other things in the world to go do that can only be experienced by hunters. Let us be the explorer of the world. Or at end game, give us some spinning plates to manage with pet movement/attacks/coordination with our shots etc in boss fights that have the POTENTIAL to be top dps if you are really good. Either/or, but at this rate we will just be playing era meta and be B tier at 40 and D tier at 60 - but with no unique differences in play style. Warrior/rogue/mage will always be at the top in classic.
